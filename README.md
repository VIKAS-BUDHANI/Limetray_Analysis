# Limetray_Analysis

### LimeTray

LimeTray is a product-startup helping restaurants market, engage and sell to more customers online. 6 out of 10 restaurants shut down in less than an year of starting up & this is not because they serve bad food or are expensive but because they fail to reach out to enough customers to cover costs.
